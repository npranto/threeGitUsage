Three Git Usages:
1. Creating a new fresh project:
	- create a new repo on github
	- create a new project file under a folder and save it
	- on terminal, go into that folder
	- do "git clone [repo URL]"
	- do "git status"
	- do "git add [fileName]"
	- do "git commit -m "[detailedMessage]"
	- do "git push origin master"
2. Adding a previously worked on file to a github repo:
	- save the worked on file under a folder
	- create a new repo on github
	- on terminal, go into the folder in which the worked on file in located
	- do "git init"
	- do "git remote add origin [repo URL]"
	- do "git pull origin master"
	- do "git status"
	- do "git add [fileName]"
	- do "commit -m "[intendedMessage]"
	- do "git push origin master"
3. Importing another's repo to your github and eventually to your local computer:
	- go into that other github repo
	- click the "fork" button on top right
	- copy the new repo URL that is now under your account
	- on terminal, go onto the folder where you want all the repo files
	- do "git clone [repo URL]"
	- do "git status"
	- do "git add -A"
	- do "git commit -m "[intendedMessage]""
